    "description": "LAVA's is a family business owned by John and Johnny LaVanish.  Since the business began in 1999 it has steadily grown.  We are now a shop of five employees serving four insurance companies as a Direct repair shop.  While we may not be on the list of preferred shops of your insurance company, don't let that deter you.  Be assured we offer the same Lifetime Warranty and high quality repairs as our competitors. As a small shop in an older building, we have the inherent advantage of a low cost business.  We don't have to make enormous profit to pay enormous overhead payments.  We have the same modern equipment as any other shop, and we can do the same repairs as any other shop, but at a cost savings to you."
